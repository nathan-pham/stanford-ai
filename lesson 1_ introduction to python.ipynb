Notebooks are powerful tools for learning programming. Google has its own notebook platform which is what we are currently using. This platform is called Google Colab.  \n","\n","Alternative to Google Colab is Jupyter Notebook. In a jupyter notebook, you can write programs in C++, Python, R and Julia. Check it out here https://jupyter.org/try. Unfortunately, the online version of Jupyter Notebook has a limit on the number of people that can support at the same time. Therefore, we are using Google Colab. In addition, Google Colab offers free GPUs, which will become extremely useful if you want to develop some hardcore machine learning programs. \n","You can read more about notebooks [here](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tips-tricks-shortcuts/) and [here](https://medium.com/@dinaelhanan/an-absolute-beginners-guide-to-google-colaboratory-d55c0eb375de).\n","\n","The nice thing about Google Colab is that you don't need to have Python or any of its libraries installed on your computer. Instead, Python and all necessary packages are installed on a cloud. As you will see later, you can also install any new Python libraries that you want. Another benefit of Google Colab and Jupyter Notebook is that you can immediately see if your code is working or not.\n","\n","Notice that in Google Colab, you can have two different cells: Code and Text. \n","You're reading this explanation in a Text cell. In fact, if you double click here, you can see the soruce code. Shift+Enter to run the cell. \n","\n","The next cell is a python code. Try to run it!
